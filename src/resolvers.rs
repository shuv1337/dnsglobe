/// Public DNS resolvers spread across regions. Anycast networks are marked as

/// Every entry has been verified to answer external queries over UDP/TCP 53.
/// Africa currently has no reliable open Do53 resolver (large ISPs there
/// refuse external queries); coverage comes from the anycast networks' POPs.
